// Version 1.0 Final Push
/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for StudySync.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and
 * role-based access for collaborative features. Data validation is relaxed
 * to allow for rapid prototyping, but authorization is strictly enforced.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores personal user data. Only the user can access their own data.
 * - /users/{userId}/{documents=**}: User-owned subcollections like tasks, focus sessions, etc.
 * - /notes/{noteId}: Stores notes. Any user can create, but only the owner can modify/delete.
 * - /collabRooms/{roomId}: Stores collaboration room data. Any authenticated user can read/list.
 * - /collabRooms/{roomId}/members/{userId}: Subcollection for members. A user can only manage their own membership.
 * - /collabRooms/{roomId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages. Access is controlled by membership in the room.
 * - /adminLogs/{adminLogId}: Stores admin logs. Only admins can access these.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin status. Presence of a document grants admin rights.
